Exercise 08: Puzzle Time!
=======

Introduction
--------
One last basic data type is the tuple. It behaves mostly like a list that cannot be modified. You can create a tuple much in the same way you can create a list, except you use parentheses instead of brackets:

    t = (1,2,3)
    print t[0]
        => 1
    t[0] = 5
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

It is useful for doing things like x,y coordinate pairs:
    sf_location = (-127.32, 45.5)

Now that you've been introduced to (almost) all the basic data types in python, practice manipulating them! These exercises are more like puzzles. You may not resort to stack overflow, you can only use what you learned in LPTHW and the standard python documentation.

Description
-------
In this folder, you will find a number of python files. Each one has a task related to data structure (data container) manipulation in python.

Concepts required:
    * dictionary manipulation
    * list manipulation
    * string manipulation
