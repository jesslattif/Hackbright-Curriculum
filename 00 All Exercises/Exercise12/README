Exercise 15: Reading practice
=======

Introduction
-------
An essential but unpracticed skill is reading other people's code. Today, we'll
be doing a little bit of reading practice.

Description
-------
In reading.py are a number of functions with mystery names. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to, _without_ executing the code, rename and
document the functions according to what they do.
